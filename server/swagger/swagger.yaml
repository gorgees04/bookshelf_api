    Introducing Bookshelf API: Explore, Collect, Share. Your go-to for storing and sharing your favorite books. Create your account and start 
    storing your book <strong>PRIVATE</strong> as for yourself or <strong>PUBLIC</strong> to be added to our big collection of books so can others 
    explore.<br/><br/>
    The server was built with `Express` and `PostgreSQL`, employing `JWT` for authentication, storing tokens securely in `HTTP-only` cookies. 
    To improve security, consider setting security headers, implementing token expiration, adding token revocation, managing secrets securely,
    validating user input, implementing rate limiting, and setting up logging and monitoring. <br/>
